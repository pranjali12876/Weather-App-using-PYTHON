# Weather-App-using-PYTHON
This project is a Python-based application designed to provide real-time weather information for any location globally. It features an intuitive and user-friendly interface that simplifies weather data retrieval. Users can search for specific cities or regions to access key weather metrics, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, and weather descriptions, which are visually represented with relevant icons.

The application leverages a robust weather API for accurate and real-time data, ensuring reliability. Built using modern Python libraries such as Tkinter, PyQt, or Kivy for the user interface, it combines functionality with a clean design, making it accessible and practical for all users.
